A better sequence game with scoring and css

Come play the game here: https://yfeix.github.io/sequence-game-v2/

Sequence Game V2 brings some pretty big changes to its predecessor. It received a major visual overhaul. It's got a sweet *C O L O R___S C H E M E* to make it feel more like a game. The game now follows a "storyline" in which you don't get to choose the length of the sequence. It starts from 4 tiles and slowly increases to 8 tiles as you complete each level. There's also a gnarly *time formula* that calculates how long you get to memorize the sequence.

Also it's a heavy work-in-progress project so there will be bugs.
